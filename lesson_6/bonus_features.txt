1. Improved join
2. Keep score
    Keep score of how many times the player and computer each win.
    Don't use global or constant variables.
    Make it so that the first player to 5 wins the game.

3. Computer AI: defense
    The computer currently picks a square at random.
    That's not very interesting. Let's make the computer defensive minded
    If there's an immediate threat, then it will defend the 3rd square.
    We'll consider an "immediate threat" to be 2 squares
    marked by the opponent in a row. If there's no immediate threat,
    then it will just pick a random square.

4. Computer AI: offense
    piggy back on our find_at_risk_square from bonus #3 above
    turn it into an attacking mechanism as well.
    The logic is simple: if the computer already has 2 in a row,
    then fill in the 3rd square, as opposed to moving at random.

5. Computer turn refinements
6. Improve the game loop
