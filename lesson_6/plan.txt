First, break down the problem into smaller pieces.

Map out the flow of the program in a flowchart,
using sub-processes to encapsulate well-defined components of the problem.

When you're ready to tackle a component or sub-process,
    write out the pseudo-code for that sub-process only.
    come up with clear inputs for the sub-process,
                clear outputs you expect

Play around with the code.
Write every line of code and make sure you understand it

Do the assignments in sequence.
We'll walk you through the necessary steps to break down the problem.

Don't be afraid to watch the walk-through videos.
Use those as guard rails so you're not spinning your wheels stuck for too long.
But don't just sit back and watch the videos without typing or coding along.
